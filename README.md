# Smile_detection
## 😄 Smile Detection with OpenCV 😄
🌟 Overview 🌟<br>
This Smile Detection project uses Python and OpenCV's powerful pre-trained classifiers to detect faces and smiles in real-time using a webcam feed. It serves as a fun and practical introduction to computer vision and Haar cascade classifiers.

🧰 Features 🧰<br>
Real-time face and smile detection via webcam.<br>

Uses Haar cascade classifiers for accurate detection.<br>

Easy-to-run script with minimal dependencies.<br>

Lightweight and beginner-friendly.<br>

🚀 Installation 🚀<br>
To get started, follow these steps:<br>
# Clone the repo <br>
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smile-detection.git <br>
cd smile-detection<br>

# Install dependencies <br>
make sure you have opencv/opencv2 downloaded, if not type in the terminal: <br>
pip install opencv-python <br>
▶️ Usage ▶️ <br>
python smile_detection.py <br>
# Run the detection script using: <br>

python smile_detection.py <br>
Make sure your webcam is enabled and ready!<br>

🧪 Testing 🧪<br>
Run the script and smile! The window will highlight your face and detect your smile in real-time. Try different lighting conditions to test accuracy. <br>
