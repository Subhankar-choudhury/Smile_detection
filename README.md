# Smile_detection
## 😄 Smile Detection with OpenCV 😄
🌟 Overview 🌟
This Smile Detection project uses Python and OpenCV's powerful pre-trained classifiers to detect faces and smiles in real-time using a webcam feed. It serves as a fun and practical introduction to computer vision and Haar cascade classifiers.

🧰 Features 🧰
Real-time face and smile detection via webcam.

Uses Haar cascade classifiers for accurate detection.

Easy-to-run script with minimal dependencies.

Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

🚀 Installation 🚀
To get started, follow these steps:
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smile-detection.git
cd smile-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python
▶️ Usage ▶️
# Run the detection script using:

python smile_detection.py
Make sure your webcam is enabled and ready!

🧪 Testing 🧪
Run the script and smile! The window will highlight your face and detect your smile in real-time. Try different lighting conditions to test accuracy.
